does not delight in
because has fully understood it to the end
because has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that with being as condition there is birth, and that for whatever has come to be there is ageing and death. therefore, through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathāgata has awakened to supreme full enlightenment
