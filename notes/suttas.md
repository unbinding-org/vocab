the root of all things

for each of
elements, beings, gods, jhanas, senses, diversity, all, nibbāna

Ordinary Person (Puthujjana)

perceives it (as) what I am, what is mine
conceives it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
delights in it
because has not fully understood it
The Disciple in Higher Training (Sekkha)

directly knows it
should not conceive it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
should not delight in it
because must fully understand it
The Arahant

directly knows it
does not conceive it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
does not delight in it
because has fully understood it
because is free from lust through the destruction of lust
because is free from hate through the destruction of hate
because is free from delusion through the destruction of delusion
The Tathāgata

directly knows
does not conceive
does not delight in
because has fully understood it to the end
because has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that with being as condition there is birth, and that for whatever has come to be there is ageing and death. therefore, through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathāgata has awakened to supreme full enlightenment

mn4

Bhaya­bhe­rava
Fear and Dread

Remote jungle-thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure.
Seclusion is hard to practise.
It is hard to enjoy solitude. 
One would think the jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.

Reasons to find great solace in dwelling in the forest.

I am purified in bodily conduct
I am purified in livelihood
I am uncovetous
I have a mind of loving-kindness
I am without sloth and torpor
I have a peaceful mind
I have gone beyond doubt
I am not given to self-praise and disparagement of others
I am free from trepidation
I have few wishes
I am energetic
I am established in mindfulness
I am possessed of concentration
I am possessed of wisdom
