the root of all things

for each of
elements, beings, gods, jhanas, senses, diversity, all, nibbāna

Ordinary Person (Puthujjana)

perceives it (as) what I am, what is mine
conceives it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
delights in it
because has not fully understood it
The Disciple in Higher Training (Sekkha)

directly knows it
should not conceive it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
should not delight in it
because must fully understand it
The Arahant

directly knows it
does not conceive it (as, in, appart from) what I am, what is mine
does not delight in it
because has fully understood it
because is free from lust through the destruction of lust
because is free from hate through the destruction of hate
because is free from delusion through the destruction of delusion
The Tathāgata

directly knows
does not conceive
does not delight in
because has fully understood it to the end
because has understood that delight is the root of suffering, and that with being as condition there is birth, and that for whatever has come to be there is ageing and death. therefore, through the complete destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of cravings, the Tathāgata has awakened to supreme full enlightenment

Bhaya­bhe­rava
Fear and Dread

Remote jungle-thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure.
Seclusion is hard to practise.
It is hard to enjoy solitude. 
One would think the jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.

Reasons to find great solace in dwelling in the forest.

Ākaṅ­khey­ya

be devoted to internal serenity of mind, 
not neglect meditation, 
be possessed of insight, and 
dwell in empty huts


May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the holy life, respected and esteemed by them

May I be one to obtain [the 4 requisites]

May the services of those whose [4 requisites] I use bring them great fruit and benefit

When my kinsmen and relatives who have passed away and died remember me with confidence in their minds, 
may that bring them great fruit and great benefit

May I become a conqueror of discontent and delight, and may discontent not conquer me; may I abide transcending discontent whenever it arises

May I become a conqueror of fear and dread, and may fear and dread not conquer me; may I abide transcending fear and dread whenever they arise

May I become one to obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now

May I contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms

May I, with the destruction of three fetters, become a [stream-enterer]

May I, with the destruction of three fetters and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, become a [once-returner]

May I, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, become a [non-returner]

May I wield the various kinds of [supernormal power]

May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well as near

May I understand [the minds] of other beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with my own mind.

May I recollect [my manifold past lives].

May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate; may I understand how beings pass on according to their actions

May I, by realising for myself with direct knowledge, here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints

the 4 requisites: robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites

stream enterer: no longer subject to perdition, bound for deliverance, headed for enlightenment
once-returner: returning once to this world to make an end of suffering
non-returner: due to reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbāna, without ever returning from that world

supernormal power: having been one, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I wield bodily mastery, even as far as the Brahma-world

understand a mind: a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; may I understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; may I understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; may I understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; may I understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; may I understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; may I understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated
